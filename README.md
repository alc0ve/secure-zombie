# Secure-Zombie: A Password Generator

## Description

Having a good password keeps your accounts safe and secure while ensuring a sense of good cybersecurity. With the use of JavaScript, and somehwat basic understanding of probabilities, a password generator app can be created. With a click of button, one can have letters (both Upper and Lower case), numbers, and special characters jumbled into a line of his or hers desire-- within some limits (being between 8-128). I learned while creating this application, that JavaScript can be used in many ways-- and in MANY other ways to create a single job. There are many things in JavaScript that allows users to interact with whichever application one desires to create. I will admit this was not a simple task.

## Installation

I was given a pre-filled code which included an html, CSS, and JavaScript files. Both html and CSS were filled so that a text box was already created. My job was figure out in JavaScript, how to make the application provide a strong password for the user should they need it. Through many searches in Google, I was able to start with pseudocoding to put into steps of how I should go about starting. I also researched JavaScript methods, arrays, functions, key values, iterations, conditional statements, for loops, logical comparison operators, and referred back to some lessons learned in Bootcamp. There are a few 'console.log' methods within the JavaScript file so that if anyone would like to confirm in DevTools console, they would be able to. Those methods also helped me to see what kind of interaction correlated within my JavaScript. With SO many tabs running with research, and with the help of a few colleagues, I was able to get my ducks in a row to create a working application that generates an obscure password.

## Usage

A user that needs a new, secure password can utilize this application to generate a strong password. With a click of a button, he or she will be able to choose the length of the password. He or she can choose between simple 8 characters, or if they plan on writing it down somewhere or saving it- up to 128 characters. The user will then go through prompts that ask what criteria the user would want the password to consist of, such as :lower/upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters to beef up security. To ensure the genereator works properly, the user will have to choose at least one yes out of the four prompts shown. When desired user criteria is met, a password is generated into the text box directly on the webpage.

## Credits!

I could not have figured out all of the special characters myself so I used this website to get the special characters used in my JavaScript file: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters.
I really could not have worked through this project alone without the help of my colleagues, specifically Blair and BJ, to help debug (SO MUCH DEBUGGING), and assist in issues I could not solve through just research. BJ helped so much with pseudocoding and helping me get to a point where I wasn't overwhelemed. He showed me how important that step was before starting any project. 
There isn't one specific page that helped me with the whole creating of the application, but some webpages I referred to were: W3 Schools, MDN web docs, and Stack Overflow. And of course many YouTube videos out there explaining JavaScript.
